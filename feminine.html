	<div id="header">The Divine Feminine Principle</div>

	<div id="backgroundcover"></div>

	<div id="textcover">Womack discusses the role that women and feminist thought have played in the development of Afrofuturism in a chapter called “The Divine Feminine in Space.” She outlines what she calls the “divine feminine principle,” where nature, creativity, receptivity, healing, intuition, and mysticism are partners, rather than counters, to science, technology, and achievement. She argues Afrofuturism differs from other sci-fi and futurist movements because of how it has embraced this principle. Since Afrofuturism encourages breaking down old structures and putting forth one’s own narratives, women can redefine their Blackness, womanhood, and more while having voices that are not positioned in relation to patriarchy or racism. “The main commonality is their individuality and a desire to encourage free thinking and end the -isms that have plagued the presenta and the recent past … Female Afrofuturists create their own norm, and the rest of the world just tries to catch up.” In the past, Black women’s contributions have mostly been viewed as cultural rather than scientific, but Afrofuturism subverts that.</div>

	<div id="imagecover"></div>

	<div id="backgroundcover2">She takes it a step further and argues that not only do women have expanded agency in Afrofuturism, they have made it so that feminism is central to the movement. A feminist space works against all of the “isms,” prioritizes of cooperation over competition, accepts all types of women, and empowers women’s voices. Throughout the history of the movement, women have had a different approach in the way that they use Afrofuturism, meaning that they have carved out their own niche while still driving the movement forward at large with their futuristic, norm-breaking values.</div>
